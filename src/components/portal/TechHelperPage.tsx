First, let me know what password you forgot:

- Password to unlock your phone or computer?
- Password for a website (like Facebook, Amazon)?
- Wi-Fi password?

Tell me which one, and I'll walk you through exactly how to reset it.`,

      'Should I write down my passwords?': `Yes! Writing down passwords is actually a GOOD idea - as long as you keep them safe.

The safest way:

Keep a small notebook just for passwords
- Store it in a drawer at home
- Don't carry it with you
- Don't leave it where visitors can see it

What to write:
- Website name (like "Amazon")
- Your username or email
- The password
- Date you created it

Where NOT to keep passwords:
- On sticky notes on your monitor
- In your wallet or purse
- On your phone in Notes
- In an email to yourself

Even better option:
Your phone can remember passwords for you! 
- iPhone does this automatically
- Android does this too
- Much more secure

But keeping a written notebook at home is perfectly fine and very common!

Would you like help setting up your phone to remember passwords instead?`,

      'What makes a strong password?': `Let me explain what makes a good, safe password.

A strong password has:

1. At least 12 characters (letters and numbers)
2. Mix of CAPITAL and lowercase letters
3. At least one number
4. At least one symbol (like ! @ # $)

Good examples:
- Surfing@Maui2025!
- MyDog$Loves2Run
- Coffee&Books#Morning

Bad examples:
- password
- 123456
- Your birthday or name

Easy trick - Use a sentence:
Think of something you'll remember, then:
- "I love surfing at Poipu Beach"
- Becomes: ILove$urfing@Poipu!

Important:
- Use different passwords for different websites
- Don't use the same password everywhere
- If one gets hacked, they all get hacked!

Write it down safely:
Keep your passwords in a notebook at home, in a safe place.

What is it?
Think of it like a safe where you keep all your passwords.

- Works on your phone and computer

How it works:

1. You create one "master password"
   - This is the only one you need to remember!

   - Website passwords
   - App passwords
   - Everything!

   - The password manager fills it in automatically
   - You don't have to type anything!

Is it safe?
Yes! Very safe.
- Your passwords are locked up tight
- Much safer than writing them down
- Safer than using the same password everywhere

Do you need one?
Good news - your phone already has one built in!
- iPhone has iCloud Keychain
- Android has Google Password Manager
- They work automatically

It's already there - you just need to turn it on!`,
