## 3. 🔍 **Device-Specific Settings Finder**

### What It Does:
Helps locate settings that move with OS updates and accounts for different device versions.

### How It Works:

#### A) Version-Aware Instructions:
The system already provides device-specific answers by asking "Which device are you using?" for relevant questions.

Example flow:
```
User: "How do I update my phone?"
→ System: "Which device are you using?"
→ [iPhone] [Android] [Windows] [Mac]
→ User clicks "iPhone"
→ System provides iOS-specific steps
```

#### B) OS Version Adaptations:
Instructions include version differences:
- "Click 'System Settings' (or 'System Preferences' on older Macs)"
- "Swipe down from top-right (or swipe up from bottom on older iPhones)"
- Covers multiple navigation paths

#### C) "Your Device Looks Different?" Support:
Instructions include fallback methods:
- Primary method (latest OS)
- Alternative method (older OS)
- Visual clues ("Look for the gear icon")
- Search method ("Type 'Settings' in search box")

### Example Questions Supported:
- "Where did [setting] move in iOS 17?"
- "How do I find Settings on my phone?"
- "My phone looks different from the instructions"
- "The button isn't where you said it would be"

### Adaptive Language:
Instructions use flexible descriptions:
- "Look for the GEAR icon (Settings)"
- "It might be called 'System Settings' or 'System Preferences'"
- "Usually on the right side, but varies by phone"
- "Can't find it? Try searching..."

## 💻 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

  timestamp: number;
}>>([]);
const [showSavedLibrary, setShowSavedLibrary] = useState(false);
```

### Key Functions:

#### saveAnswer():
```typescript
const saveAnswer = (question: string, answer: string, device?: string) => {
  const newSaved = {
    question,
    answer,
    device,
    timestamp: Date.now() // Unique identifier
  };
  setSavedAnswers(prev => [...prev, newSaved]);
  alert('✅ Answer saved to your Help Library!');
};
```

#### printInstructions():
```typescript
const printInstructions = (question: string, answer: string, device?: string) => {
  const printWindow = window.open('', '_blank');
  // Generates HTML with:
  // - Large text (22-36px)
  // - Checkbox inputs for steps
  // - Print-optimized CSS
  // - Mālama branding
  printWindow.document.write(/* HTML template */);
  printWindow.document.close();
};
```
